# Notation Explorer

A simple, fast tool for converting **large numbers** between **scientific notation** (like `1e15`) and **short abbreviations** (like `1Qa`).

This app is made for **players, students, and anyone dealing with huge numbers**—especially common in incremental / idle games.

## :sparkles: What You Can Do

### :mag: Lookup

* Type an abbreviation (e.g. `Qa`, `1Sp`, `No`)
* Or type scientific notation (e.g. `1e15`, `e30`)
* Instantly see:

  * The abbreviation
  * The scientific notation
  * The power of ten (exponent)

### :abacus: Calculator

Work with extremely large values **without lag or overflow**:

* Compare two values (which is bigger?)
* Add or subtract magnitudes
* Multiply or divide powers of ten

Examples:

* `1Qa × 1D`
* `1e120 ÷ 1e30`

The calculator stays stable even at **absurd sizes** (well beyond `1e1000`).

### :clipboard: Full Table Browser
